# Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
> Easy

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list `sorted` as well.

## Examples
```
Inputï¼š head = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

        return head
```

    while head.next:
        if head.val == head.next.val:
            head.next = head.next.next
        else:
            head = head.next
    return output
